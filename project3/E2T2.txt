Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- S3 secret should enabled block public access and lifecycle policies
- Make SG for Ec2 Web app C3 more restrict, remove allow all port in SG of Ec2 Web app C3


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- make 1 ec2 in private subnet and create SG for that ec2. Ec2 (webApp) will become bastion host.
- Make s3 secret policy only can get from new ec2 in private subnet and only some specific Ip for bussiness user
