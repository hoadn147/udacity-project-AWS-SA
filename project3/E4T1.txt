# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Restrict SSH access by specific in security group on ec2 web service-c3, this will limit access to SSH to only authorized IP addresses and block unauthorized attempts from the internet.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA): his will require users to enter a unique code generated by a secondary authentication device, in addition to the SSH password, before they can log in.
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Create ec2 in private subnet and only ec2 web service-c3 can ssh to that. This new ec2 will have role to get data in s3 secret and s3 policy in s3 only allow for that ec2 .
- White list in Ip for user have a priveleged bussiness and make SG and attach that SG for ec2 web service-c3, priveleged bussiness user will have ssh to bastion host and ssh to private ec2 to update and access s3 secret.
- Create NaCL and using VPC Flow for control what Ip can access to ec2.
