# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- AWS Config
- IaC scanning tools like Checkov, CloudSploit.

### Example vulnerability
- An EC2 instance is launched with an outdated security group rule that allows inbound traffic over port 22 (SSH) from any source IP address.
- One or more AWS resources, such as an S3 bucket, has overly permissive access control policies, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- Amazon Inspector
-  Docker Bench Security

### Example vulnerability
- An instance is found using an outdated version of the NGINX web server that is known to be vulnerable to a specific security exploit.
- A Docker container is found running with a privilege level that is unnecessary for its required operations, creating a possible privilege escalation risk.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS Security Hub
- Cloud Custodian
### Example vulnerability
- An EC2 instance has a misconfigured IAM role and security group settings, allowing anyone in the role to access data they're not authorized to see. 
- An EC2 instance is launched without the required security group defined, opening it up to various network attacks.
